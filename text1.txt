<h3>FoCoMX 2019</h3>
<p>The Fort Collins Musicians Association (FoCoMA) is proud to present the 11th Annual Fort Collins Music eXperiment (FoCoMX) on April 26 & 27, 2019.</p>
<p>We are so lucky to have such a vibrant scene that is supported by music lovers and our community at large. Thank you to everyone for making such an event possible! FoCoMX, presented by the nonprofit Fort Collins Musicians Association (FoCoMA) is 2-day festival with well over 200 artists. Afternoon and evening performances offer a wealth of family-friendly programming. Later-evening performances feature rock, singer-songwriter, bluegrass, funk, reggae and more.</p>
<p>FoCoMX started in 2009 as a grassroots experiment in promoting local music. The festival has grown over the years and we now see attendance of approximately 5500  and has garnering national attention and earning FoCoMX the unofficial title of &quot;The Biggest Little Festival in America.&quot;  </p>

                <p>If children are attending the festival itself and going to venues, they do need a wristband no matter how young they are, as they would still be counted towards legal occupancy at the venues. Wristbands are required for all venues, including all-ages venues, the museum, and, any non-childrens' programming. Wristbands for children are the same price as those for adults because, as part of our mission, we're trying to pay the artists fairly for playing.</p>
