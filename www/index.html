<h3>FoCoMX 2019</h3>
<p>The Fort Collins Musicians Association (FoCoMA) is proud to present the 11th Annual Fort Collins Music eXperiment (FoCoMX) on April 26 & 27, 2019.</p>
<p>We are so lucky to have such a vibrant scene that is supported by music lovers and our community at large. Thank you to everyone for making such an event possible! FoCoMX, presented by the nonprofit Fort Collins Musicians Association (FoCoMA) is 2-day festival with well over 200 artists. Afternoon and evening performances offer a wealth of family-friendly programming. Later-evening performances feature rock, singer-songwriter, bluegrass, funk, reggae and more.</p>
<p>FoCoMX started in 2009 as a grassroots experiment in promoting local music. The festival has grown over the years and we now see attendance of approximately 5500  and has garnering national attention and earning FoCoMX the unofficial title of &quot;The Biggest Little Festival in America.&quot;  </p>

                <p>If children are attending the festival itself and going to venues, they do need a wristband no matter how young they are, as they would still be counted towards legal occupancy at the venues. Wristbands are required for all venues, including all-ages venues, the museum, and, any non-childrens' programming. Wristbands for children are the same price as those for adults because, as part of our mission, we're trying to pay the artists fairly for playing.</p>

Michael Kirkpatrick is best known as the 2014 Telluride Troubadour, and ringleader of Holler!ween--a Northern Colorado music festival in its 16th year. Michaels sonic affair with music has brought his rich baritone into The Santa Fe Opera, Folk clubs, RocknRoll venues and Bluegrass Festivals. Performing over 250 dates a year on guitars, mandolins and voice, Michael brings it all to the theater: sweat, sensuality, tears, and sometimes blood.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/michael_kirkpatrick.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1xmQlWOQGovhkMdke11AUE" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/michaelkirkpatrickmusic" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.michaelkirkpatrickmusic.com/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Steelin' The Spaceways</h2><h3 class="artist">Blues-Jazz</h3><p class="artist">Steelin&#39; The Spaceways is a venture launched by Fort Collins-based musician Jesse Bates. Born and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas, Jesse has toured as a side musiciarn for many bands over the years, filling the roles of steel guitarist, bassist, drummer, guitarist, and other roles as needed. He currently tours as a member of the instrumental psychedelic band Grails from Portland, OR and fills the drum position as needed for Little Rock-based Amasa Hines. Past bands have included Bobby Bare Jr.&#39;s Young Criminal Starvation League, Quiet Life, Dolorean, and Holy Sons. Although the pedal steel guitar has led him down the path of Americana/Folk more often than not (his steel guitar can be heard on the latest release by Gregory Alan Isakov &#34;Evening Machines&#34;), Jesse&#39;s imagination is sparked by the abstract elements found in prog-rock, fusion, psychedelia, and new age music. Drawing from this limitless source, he seeks to combine the steel guitar with these elements to move towards a territory that the steel guitar is not commonly associated with. Joining Jesse in this project are Judson Spillyards (guitar) and Ryan Hitt (bass) of the Little Rock-based band Amasa Hines. The three have been musical brothers since their teens, playing in various formations around Little Rock, and are reuniting to bring Steelin&#39; The Spaceways to FoCoMX.

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">No Doubt About It</h2><h3 class="artist">Cover-Tribute</h3><p class="artist">Senorita Sometimes front woman (Stacy Sevelin) grew up seeing No Doubt in both Los Angeles and Orange County, CA. Gwen Stefani was one of her favorite female singers. It dawned on her that she should try to start up a No Doubt tribute band in Fort Collins. She then quickly begged her bandmates Menyus Borocz (Wire Faces) and Sean Speer (Stella Luce) to play a No Doubt tribute set for Halloween at Surfside7 in 2017. Both miraculously agreed. Stacy then asked Craig Powell to play bass for the show (he was not in Senorita Sometimes at this time). After the successful and fun show, Craig soon joined the band as full-time bass player! Cassie Cowan joined Senorita Sometimes in late 2018 and plays keys/backup vocals in No Doubt About It! If you are feeling nostalgic and love No Doubt, you should check out this cover band! Many people have stated that NDAI does a fantastic job and plays an awesome tribute to the band.

But FORTY-FIVE PLUS ONE attempts to bridge the gap between the two. DJ Alf plays a set of instrumentals from vinyl 45s. Hes periodically joined on stage by musicians who add something to the record hes currently playing. In the past few years, DJ Alf has been joined by singers, MCs, guitarists, bassists, drummers, keyboardists, percussionists, horn sections, string sections, a youth choir, a guy playing buckets, and a guy playing a modified Nintendo Game Boy - each adding their own unique twist to the DJ set. At FoCoMX, hell be joined by local and national musicians from the festival line-up, giving people a chance to see and hear these performers in a new and different setting.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/FORTY-FIVE-PLUS-ONE-WITH-DJ-ALF_PHOTO_0.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/45plus1/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Deborah Stafford & the State of Affairs</h2><h3 class="artist">R&B-Soul-Funk</h3><p class="artist">Deborah Stafford & The State Of Affairs Band formed about two years ago with some of the finest musicians from Denver, Boulder, Longmont and Fort Collins. The goal was to promote original songs written by Deborah Stafford & Doc Dougherty backed by a very strong rhythm section with a strong saxophone influence. Playing their originals in the past summers Mile High Blues Society International Blues Challenge and winning earned them the right to represent Colorado in Memphis in January 2019. They will compete against the winners of the other States and European countries for the Blues title. Cary Morin won this same honor a couple years ago. A debut CD was released in May, 2018, of all originals. It has received airplay across the State especially on KRFC receiving many plays and received the 2nd most played band in late August, 2018. The CD won the Mile High Blues Society&#39;s Best Self Produced CD and was also entered by them into a National Best Of Blues CD to be judged in Memphis the same time as the 4 day IBC competition. I would encourage you to speak to KRFC&#39;s Deni LaRue and Big Steve Weintraub as a source of reference having played our CD on the air and seeing us perform several times. The band normally performs in Denver & Boulder venues. Bringing the act lately to the Fort Collins Scene the band sold out Avos, the Whiskey and the Swing Station. The band is led by Deborah Stafford on vocals, Dave Doc Dougherty on guitar, Bob Tiger on bass, Alanya Simmons on saxophone and Doug Murphy on drums. Alanya was voted by the Colorado Blues Society in 2017 as the best horn player in the State and she is. Our main goal performing live is too bring excitement and energy to the audience with powerful originals and to pack dance floors which the band does. Many local Blues Dance Troupes and dancers follow the band up and down the front range. It&#39;s all about making music that matters. Please check out our website as a source to see us perform live and hear the CD for yourself. Energy defines our songs and live performances. The band will be performing live on KRFC&#39;s Live At Lunch on January 11th hosted by Deni LaRue and performing at the Swing Station on January 18th. Bring yer dancing shoes and join the Blues Dance Troupe planning to attend. It&#39;s our send off to Memphis.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/web178d.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3SXIWd0ogFtHk6sau2mWwL?si=XL4_YbVLSBa2czYv2fnrZA" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DeborahStaffordandTheStateofAffairs/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.stateofaffairsband.com/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

His energetic live performances coupled with his sobering, heart-worn lyrics persuade his audience to set their drinks down one minute and raise them up the next. 2017 was highlighted with a main stage opening spot in support of The Gin Blossoms at Taste of Fort Collins while 2018 saw performances at the 97thannual Greeley Stampede, the PRCA Pro Rodeo Circuit Finals, Larimer County Fair, and an opening slot for Sunny Sweeney on her Colorado tour stop. He is currently splitting time between Northern Colorado and Nashville writing, performing, and loving every minute of this crazy ride. Yeah, all that, and then add in a drummer that will change your heartbeat - for the better, a bass player that would give Bob Moore a run for his money (literally - he&#39;s a hell of a gambler), and a screaming guitar that reflects everything from Bob Seger to Bob Sagat - think about how that sounds?!

Over the last two years we published our first LP, launched our website, released our first live recording, played numerous live shows, and have written and polished an LP&#39;s worth of new original songs that draw on the chemistry we&#39;ve developed together as a band. Look for a new release in early 2019. We love to play in our home city of Fort Collins. We eat, drink, practice and gig here, taking care to support our kindred bands and collaborators along the way.

Both instruments blended the influence of African and European cultures to create the core of Americana. Standing the test of time, this duo paints a picture of our history through music, and the essence of bluegrass is brought to life with 9 strings in Leanaway. Mike Fritz and Hannah Barnes come from very different musical backgrounds. Mike polished his skills through bluegrass jams, and Hannah grew up playing classical violin music almost exclusively. Their differences in aesthetic are almost symbolic of their instruments&#39; countries of origin, and blend together to create an expressive duet. Leanaway plays fiddle tunes of all varieties, encompassing old-time, Appalachian, and celtic music.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/bandpic.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

Gliding seamlessly between boldly improvisational and tightly rehearsed, it&#39;s always guaranteed to be a wild ride. And much like the mythic cactus cat, they are covered in sharp spines and inhabit saguaros.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/CactusCat-6012.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/520130916&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/cactuscatband" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.cactuscatband.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">The 14ers</h2><h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3><p class="artist">Life is short, do the things you love. Ryan Kirkpatrick brews lively lyrics with catchy acoustic based songs, spends lots of time outdoors, and laughs a lot. The 14ers (named after Colorados highest mountain peaks) is a musical adventure led by Kirkpatrick himself.The 14ers have worn a path around the US and have shared the stage with acts such as Donavon Frankenreiter, The Wind and The Wave, Rusted Root, Howie Day and Brushfire Records ALO just to name a few. At the helm of the songwriting ship, Kirkpatrick writes about anything that makes him smile - including adventure, friends, love, and fun. This refreshing mountaintop folk-pop style of music is best enjoyed outdoors, as is evidenced by the new single &#34;Mountain Town&#34; that Kirkpatrick wrote almost entirely while riding on ski lift chairs and in hot-air balloon baskets:Avalanche bombs and beeps from the plows Champagne powder buries our houseWe hit the hill - its still coming downIts a good life in a mountain town And if creating music that feels this good is a crime - there are many talented musicians that are guilty by their association with The 14ers. Barry Bates (drums), Stu Cruden (bass), Jacob Anderson (keys), and Paul Martin (electric guitar) most frequently join Kirkpatrick in a variety of stage footprints that range from stripped-down intimate sets to full-band shows -  and the full-blown fun vibes are guaranteed either way! Kirkpatrick is finishing up a multi-year project for The 14ers recording new songs in different locations such as &#34;Westbound&#34; that was recorded at Jack Johnsons Brushfire Records LA studio featuring Adam Topol (Jack Johnson), Chris Joyner (Jason Mraz), plus Nick Bearden and Brad Lindsay (Jamestown Revival). Four different singles have been released from this project and expect a full-length collective album release in April 2019. &#34;One of the highlights of my life is making music with like-minded, talented, and good-hearted musicians -  Im very lucky to have the collaborators I do&#34; says Kirkpatrick.Kirkpatrick is no stranger to the road; he splits his time between writing/performing/recording music and guiding educational hiking, skiing, bicycling, and photography programs from the mountains and deserts of the west all the way to Africa where he leads Mount Kilimanjaro expeditions each year.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/RK_Pachyderm-005_medRes.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1FNsxTGsR7NExsIw9FIZBA?si=13wYIQmIRBe3rx_8b5-f9A" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/The14ers" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.The14ersmusic.com/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Venture Still</h2><h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3><p class="artist">If Daft Punk and Jack Johnson adopted Portugal the man and Coldplay&#39;s child and raised it as their own = Venture Still. Based around the catchy songwriting of their front man, Chris Carter, Venture Still blends thick organic textures with electronic elements to produce their take on alternative pop/rock. Formed in the fall of 2016, Venture Stills music is the result of close friends coming together to express their shared passion. Drawing from a spectrum of experiences, Carters lyrics embody the harmony and dissonance found in everyday struggles. Backing Carter, is bassist Rob Wiberg, dummer Dominic Fante, and pianist Elvin Holderfield. Inspired by bass greats like Victor Wooten, Rob provides funky slap riffs and creamy melodies that give each song a contagious groove. Dominic, a acomplished drummer and percussionist, ties the rhythm section together and brings a rhythm to each song that is hard to resist. Elvin, a classically trained pianist and composer, lays down a bed of textures from piano to ambient pads. In Conclusion: Chris Carter is a tall man and plays guitar while singing. Elvin Holderfield is a short half-asian man and plays piano. Rob Wiberg has very large hands that he uses to play bass. Dominic Fante bangs on things. Together they are friends. Together they are Venture Still.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/venture-11sml.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5vAlJeus33FrBycq1sNzEs?si=G1XBJvz1R0qY_YAQxadfRQ" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/venturestill" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.venturestill.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

Combine this with a visual spectacle that is one part animal-object, one part Glam rock, and a bit of edge, and the result is am unforgettable performance. WhiteCatPink plays live drums and sings over original compositions and music written digitally in Ableton Live. With subjects ranging from catfights to his famous teddy bear, Paisley, to flowers from outer space, the milieu remains fresh and unusual. His most recent offering&#34;The LoveBalletGirl E&#34; sees WhiteCatPink in top chic form with vocals sung in both English and French over a smooth, glossy blend of electronic music and hard-hitting drums.

Rootsy and real, neither revivalist nor retro, the Hi-Beams brand of country music is as boundless and electrifying as America itself. Equal parts Hank Williams and Johnny Depp, front man Halden Wofford pours forth a potent mix of rocked-up honky tonk, western swing, Dylanesque originals and spaghetti western epics. There is no creative limit to the songwriter, illustrator, author, storyteller and singer. But Halden has met his match in the Hi-Beams. Each outrageous tale he spins is met by the whine and wail of the steel guitar, the furious double-neck electric guitar and mandolin, and the relentless thump of the upright bass and drums. From Red Rocks to rodeos, the Fillmore Auditorium to the back of a flatbed truck, Prairie Home Companion to performing arts centers, Halden Wofford and the Hi-Beams deliver an unforgettable and original night of American music.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/hibeams_0_0_0.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/61YVjdZUrntOWkXEYE7W1D?si=VgK1HU5DR6KAXYk4tF0NPw" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hibeams/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.hibeams.com/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

Guitarist Lela Roy&#39;s soaring voice powers the band&#39;s songs, which mine the sounds of dream-pop, 90s alternative rock, and experimental indie.

Joined by synth bassist Ben Weirich and drummer Dylan Johnson on stage, the quartets brand of 80s tinged synthpop was born in March 2016 and has since garnered a steadfast following. In June 2018 Retrofette released its latest single, Lover in Japan, a summery dance anthem that inspired by classic 80s new wave. Retrofete has shared the stage with acts such as Flight Facilities, Anomalie, Magic Sword, and Fever the Ghost. They have played on the legendary Red Rocks stage, sold out audiences at Denvers Hi Dive and Ophelias, and were selected as the Best Pop Act of 2017 in Colorado by Westword Magazine.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/bg-2018.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5uPtGc05hlMwK38pvwL0eL?si=-eMDUC6lS3C-3Lmgbhh79Q" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/retrofette/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.retrofette.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">TMULE</h2><h3 class="artist">Singer-Songwriter</h3><p class="artist">Known for his gritty vocals and rowdy rhythm guitar for the grungy Colorado folk rockers The Longest Day of the Year, TMULE brings together lyrical roots and folk stories like early Neil Young with the grunge of Pearl Jam and sonic celebrations like Wilco. He has been playing shows, dreaming, and drifting from Kalamazoo to Ann Arbor to Boston to Boulder, and finally finding a home in Fort Collins, Music City. TMULE is a librarian at heart, and a creature of exploration and empathy with a penchant for folk lyrics, grunge/rock music, and literature. He folds and unfolds each moment through creation to collapse. Through ruin and redemption. TMULE strives to dig deep and feel out stories of love, dreams of life, visions of longing and loss. Though his songs have been used as the backbone of the band The Longest Day of the Year, his songwriting bleeds far beyond the full-frontal folk-rock of TLDOTY and also reaches into the smaller, tender, and quiet spaces of his heart and mind. After 2 full band LPs with The Longest Day of the Year since 2012 (&#34;Turn Into the Ground&#34; and &#34;Carapace&#34;) and over a thousand shows, strummed and bellowed, TMULE&#39;s latest release is an intimate set of songs called Worldless Lullabies and is the companion to a poetry book called &#34;Book of Dawn / I, The Iceberg.&#34;<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/tmule%20gray.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/11mKu59gdYofJwMdh3ydxu?si=xiQpKneETTeAyWcS9_VDDA" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/tmulewax" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.tmulemusic.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Choice City Seven</h2><h3 class="artist">R&B-Soul-Funk</h3><p class="artist">Born in the foothills of the Rockies, but rooted in the sounds of modern soul, powerhouse funk, and smooth 60s R&B, Choice City Seven is an eight-piece band with a big city sound. Their live shows bring people together in celebration of down-home, no-frills, good music. The band is held together by a talented and textured rhythm section - Logan Doddridge (drums), Sean Jaster (keys), John McKay (guitar), and Jeremiah Teague (bass). The horns bring just the right boom - Greta Cornett (trumpet), John Giordanengo (trombone), Phuong Nguyen (sax). The band is fronted by a charismatic and soulful singer - Chris Leck (vocals). It started one night in a cramped practice room when 3 members of 12 Cents for Marvin each brought a friend with the goal of exploring and writing new music that sounded like whatever made them feel good at the time, no matter what genre it was. The result is a sound for everyone. From people who just want to dance to groovy hooks to heady jazz nerds. 2017 marked a major accomplishment for the band with the release of their debut album &#34;Freshman Year.&#34; &#34; By the time we recorded the album, we had spent so much time together as a band and as good friends,&#34; explains Sean Jaster, keyboard player and songwriter. &#34;We really wanted to present an album of snapshots of us growing together. Thats why theres such a wide range of songs.&#34; Choice City Seven is more than a band. Its a family where everyone feels like they belong. Audience members are never strangers. Theyre just long lost cousins invited to join the party.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/27%20-%20194.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4olN6kl84BaHRTUxcv8auC?si=TImLAUZ6Rd6aifFMMBPErw" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/choicecityseven" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://choicecityseven.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">The Velveteers</h2><h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3><p class="artist">The Velveteers are an American Rock trio from Denver, Colorado that is the epiphany of punk with the aggressive sound and grungy wisdom that transcends through 21 year old guitarist and lead singer Demi Demitro and her two drummers. Through fuzzed out guitar riffs and thunderous drums they lure their audience with vibes that come right out of a classic horror flick, the band is often compared to the likes of The Stooges, T.REX, and Led Zeppelin. In 2018 the band released their self -titled debut EP and have since been busy on the road touring. The Velveteers have supported bands such as Julian Casablancas and The Voidz, Deap Vally, Chicano Batman, and CFM to name a few. Most recently The Velveteers completed their first UK headlining tour after previously supporting Deap Vally in the UK back in 2016. The Velveteers are currently getting ready to record their first LP in 2019. They began as a sibling duo with Demi Demitro on guitar at age 17, and brother John on drums. Whilst the world has seen a succession of drum-guitar duos come and go since Meg and Jack started doing their thing, The Velveteers managed to exploit a loophole that allows them to explore their obvious love of 70&#39;s prog and glam, as well as indulging later punk influences. More recently they have added a second drummer in the form of Adrian Pottersmith (age 20), and in doing so have created something completely unique, not least through the way in which their two kits have been partly morphed together. The two sticks men now not only conjoin to create the rhythms but are also forced to share cymbals. The result is an aggressive primal sound, a thundering syncopation that spars against Demi&#39;s vocals and distorted guitar for attention, and produces a listening experience like being slammed by a ten ton truck.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/43379701_2245342458872508_9052515394551545856_n.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0Bv29HnwIu7l3YYsh9TQWk?si=_H0r_SUxTI2zd2tY2I9KHw" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thevelveteers" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">CITRA</h2><h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3><p class="artist">Hailing from Denver, CO... High-energy, guitar-driven grit-rock weaving its way through soulful, heartfelt melodies. Bright. Fast. Fun. Loud. CITRA. CITRA tore into the Denver music scene in January, 2016 with their debut EP - Ocean. The EP promised a bright future for the band, released only three months after their meeting. The album rockets off with the opening track &#34;Settle Down&#34;, and weaves it&#39;s way through an eclectic mix of melodic, at times harrowing, non-stop rock, highlighted by the band&#39;s pleadingly powerful title track, &#34;Ocean&#34;. Armed with a care-free style the band aims to inject a bit of fun into the EDM and folk-rock dominated Denver music scene. Following the release of their debut EP, Ocean, CITRA returned to the studio in the summer of 2016 to begin recording the follow-up single, &#34;Air&#34; accompanied by the B-side titled &#34;My My Mind&#34;. Released in January of 2017, the single looked to build on the momentum the band had built over their first year together. Contrasting in style, the songs continue to illustrate that CITRA will be a hard act to paint into a stylistic corner, the two tracks representing vastly different wings of the ever-clouded indie rock genre.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/CITRA%20Hi%20Dive%2011-13%20-%20Photo%20by%20Joel%20Rekiel%201.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5Y3GvaBBqzCfthQvf5n9QQ?si=L4BNRys7Q-2UhIdA5B_Xzg" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/citrabandofficial" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://citraband.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Ivory Circle</h2><h3 class="artist">Indie-Alternative</h3><p class="artist">Ivory Circle is an indie-alternative band from Denver, Colorado, started by singer-songwriter Connie Hong and producer/multi-instrumentalist Chris Beeble. They are joined by Rob Spradling on drums/ percussion. A former middle school choir teacher in a suburb of Aurora, Colorado, Hong used to write songs during her lunch breaks and play them for her students. She would eventually realize her passion was in creating and performing and left the public teaching field behind. Beeble, a longtime friend, joined the project after several song-writing and recording sessions and a mutually found musical vision. With formal musical training in multiple genres under both of their belts, Hong and Beeble released the acoustic EP, Entropy? in 2013 to positive reviews, leading to a featured song on a promotional spot for Showtime Network&#39;s The Affair, a featured song on VH1s Couples Therapy, a spot in The Denver Posts Underground Music Showcase, as well as opening slots for acclaimed national acts such as Copeland, San Fermin, Son Lux, and Caroline Smith. Most recently, Ivory Circle made KTCL&#39;s Hometown For the Holidays top 11 in 2014, for their song &#34;Faces and Colors.&#34; Hongs ability to translate personal experiences (like heartache, death, or exploration of faith) into relatable musical stories is accomplished with the help of Beeble in their full band arrangements. Spradling brings a unique technological element to Ivory Circle as a videographer and additional in-studio producer, and has designed and developed the light show programs for Ivory Circles live performances. Recognizing the relevance of maintaining a strong online and social media presence, Ivory Circle creates an intimate experience with their listeners around the world through their blog and social media outlets. Ivory Circle creates a sound as unique as it is precise, electrifying and passionate, complete with lush strings, harmonic layers, and pulsing drumbeats, interwoven between the piano and vocal lines that give them their trademark sound. The combination of their intricate compositions juxtaposed with Hongs vocal prowess make them comparable to notable musicians such as Florence+the Machine, Regina Spektor, and Kimbra. The first two EPs in their Triangle series, &#34;Equilateral&#34; and &#34;Isosceles&#34; are available on iTunes and Bandcamp. The third and final installement, &#34;Scalene&#34; was released March of 2018, followed up by their latest standalone single, &#34;Slip Away&#34; released in November of 2018.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/99CE3F70-520E-496F-BEBF-21B081DF83E0.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0bdhHiBjWApErcfkd2rokA?si=hvBb09PnRBaymWQYadMa6g" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://bit.ly/IvorycircleFB" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.ivorycircle.com/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Paul Dehaven</h2><h3 class="artist">Indie-Alternative</h3><p class="artist">Paul DeHaven has been a fixture of the thriving Denver music scene for over 10 years, well-respected for his time crafting licks and tunes as a founding member of now-defunct folk darlings Paper Bird and high desert psych virtuosos Eye & the Arrow.On Paul DeHavens debut LP, King of Gold?, he adheres to the DIY aesthetic, recording and playing nearly every instrument himself. On it he explores loss, disappointment, vanity, and a longing to find purpose and connection in a modern world seemingly devoid of these. It may be more of a generational thing ? at least for a lot of the artistic types I know. You know, were in our 30s and still living hand-to-mouth and trying to get by ? feeling just a little discouraged by the system.?The song No Gold? sums it up: The secret to being a man/Is pretending that you have/something other than a fistful of sand...There is no gold out there?. All of value lies within, and that story is told through rickety drum machines, commanding electric guitar riffs, and Pauls ever more confident vocals.The songs from Paul DeHaven&#39;s 2016 album, the EP &#34;What Are You Looking For That is Here Only&#34;, are built on tasteful and forward guitar playing, his unique songwriting, and his belief that just because it&#39;s a solo record, that doesn&#39;t mean it has to be boring. &#34;It&#39;s not a singer-songwriter record, even though I do both of those things. I think of myself as much as a guitarist and producer as I do a songwriter.&#34; The songs range from straight ahead straight ahead folk-rock (&#34;Side of the Road&#34;), fuzzed out dub (&#34;Live Your Life&#34;), to instrumental and found sound soothers (&#34;Postcoital Lullaby&#34;).Look for King of Gold? wherever you consume digital music.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/Paul-UMS-CHEST1_0.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1dVtQnk5ET2jTS7LCzdN5K?si=VE99abKmSEKEzpkx2pBFVg" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pauldehavenmusic/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.pauldehavenmusic.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Girls On Top!</h2><h3 class="artist">Cover-Tribute</h3><p class="artist">Funny, smart, and playful, Girls On Top! doesnt just play the songs you love to hear - we put on a hot show that has the crowd on their feet with an uncontrollable urge to shake their collective booty. GOT! is composed of 7 talented musicians, including 3 spirited and sassy female vocalists. The cure for the common cover band, Girls On Top! imbues every performance with theatricality, musicianship, and humor, encouraging the audience to get in on the fun. Our Manifesto From our start in 1999, Girls On Top! has set a tradition of three vibrant and theatrical frontwomen supported by a tight musical groove, with an emphasis on camaraderie and showmanship. Unlike ordinary cover bands, Girls On Top! Is committed to providing a show that is as entertaining to watch as it is to listen to. We do not merely provide a musical backdrop for our audiences; we encourage engagement, interaction, and participation. The bands sheer joy in performing together is dynamic and infectious, and leads the audience to want to get in on the action. This is the goal of every Girls On Top! performance: to persuade the audience allow themselves to be included in the fun, whether by dancing with wild abandon, by singing along to their favorite tunes, or by celebrating on the tables - provided that has been approved by the venue! Girls On Top! is not a group of musical guns-for-hire, but an eclectic family of artists with a wealth of musical experience and backgrounds; the core of the group has been consistent for so many years. We feel that our audiences deserve better than iPod versions of the songs we cover, so we arrange everything we perform as a collaborative group, with each member bringing their own varied tastes and aesthetics. The result is a polished version of the very best songs of the classic R&B genre - seasoned with influences from rock, pop, classical, jazz, and world music - which combine to create a unique sound and a musical footprint that can only belong to Girls On Top!<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/GirlsOnTop.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DUbJM83wwvM" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/girlsontopband/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.girlsontopband.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Whippoorwill</h2><h3 class="artist">Acoustic-Folk</h3><p class="artist">Cathartic, experiential alt-folk written by boots-in-the-dirt, partner-in-crime country girls (Staci Foster and Alysia Kraft) and delivered across drummer Tobias Bank&#39;s vast percussive landscape. For Whippoorwill, there&#39;s little separation between the soul and the scenery-- heartbreak is a ripped floodplain and longing, an unbroken expanse of sky. It&#39;s Cormac McCarthy meets Neil Young via non-traditional banjo, long harmonica riffs, distorted guitar, and three-part harmonies that can scorch, soar, or haunt accordingly.  Fort Collins alternative folk-rock trio Whippoorwill - Alysia Kraft (guitar, vocals), Staci Foster (guitar, banjo, harmonica, vocals), and Tobias Bank (drums, vocals) finished work this fall on a much-anticipated full-length debut album. Produced by J.Tom Hnatow (Horse Feathers, Vandaveer) and mixed by Duane Lundy (Jim James, Ringo Starr) at Lexington, KY&#39;s Shangri-La Studio, the album is the product of two years touring the American west honing a sound as expansive and raw, tough and stoically beautiful as the landscapes that source their songs. Theres a classic familiarity to the song structures (think Harvest era Neil Young), a Fleetwood Mac-ish combination of writers and voices, but an organic stitching together of diverse influences that keeps us on the fringes of country, rock and folk. I think were all pretty comfortable not quite fitting in. Its helped to explore what is ?our own sonically and meant that weve been able to tour with people in diverse genres that were equally stoked about and always learning from.? Since 2017 the band has shared sold out stages with diverse acts such as Big Thief, Shovels and Rope, Lydia Loveless, Mipso, Horse Feathers and Colin Hay. With palpable chemistry and long-game approach to creative work, Whippoorwills become a Colorado darling and one of the regions most-hyped bands on the brink. Look for the bands full-length debut in Summer 2019.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/37301766_2610854302473404_6963295142585303040_o.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4sgyRke6Tb9o2LGK5IlMMF?si=MLFcm9DyQryTxDtKIP8UCg" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/whippoorwillya/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.whippoorwillya.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

Its a feeling iZCALLi ? named for the Mexican birthplace of member-siblings Miguel (lead guitar/vocals) and Brenda Avina (bass) and the Nahuatl word for rebirth? knows well. Born on both sides of the border (drummer Luiggy Ramirez hails from Colorado) and formed in the Denver over a decade ago, iZCALLi has, over the course of four LPs and a thousand shows, swigged its evolving sound from both wells of tradition, from Latin-tinged echoes to punching rock to filthy blues, in English and in Espanol. The result is a loyal flock of fans of every color, from every background, rich or poor. The result is RETI=Rock En Tu Idioma, a community for making rock in Spanish, the music of the melting pot, which is deeply American and knows no frontiers. This is iZCALLis appeal: the kind of music that makes you leave home and return, exhilarating live shows that celebrate tradition and kin, that unite what you find with what you left behind, and open the heart, so you know you are home.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/IZCALLI%20Press%202%20small.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3CRwNbKUcFArKiNIqX6JLj?si=tWCVyfeYSm6QKb3zeeYi_w" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/izcallirock" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.izcallirock"hotmail.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

But even with the slow-and-steady approach, it&#39;s hard not to feel they are very near the tipping point of more widespread success. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle comments, &#34;Blind Alley Troubadours approach every show as if it could be the one to make them superstars. [They] put on the performance of a lifetime each time they go on stage.&#34; Scene Magazine adds, &#34;Entertaining and eclectic... poised to make a splash beyond the local music scene, so catch them while you can.&#34; Their sound is both eclectic and approachable (just as they are, off the stage), but a dark thread runs through both lyrics and music - edges of punk and woes about the depths into which we all find ourselves staring from time to time. Between the darkness, though, you&#39;re sure to find great riffs, dancy grooves, heartfelt vocals, and blistering solos. John Erik Priegel&#39;s smooth-but-weathered voice is reminiscent of a young Ryan Adams while Karmen Mitchell&#39;s classically trained violin lines provide the perfect proverbial lipstick on the pig. The rhythm section is rounded out by Kyle Shelp&#39;s tasty upright bass lines and pocket-groove drummer David &#34;Chewie&#34; Rothenberg. Fans of local Americana giants Gasoline Lollipops and The Patti Fiasco will feel right at home with the Blind Alley Troubadours.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/FoCoMX_0.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5Je4gKMELBDgFbIUbzIiPk?si=XBoW7aF-SGm9YDEzliEghA" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/blindalleytroubadours" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.blindalleytroubadours.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

Forgoing the traditional pay-to-play style rules of the music biz and forging their own path provides the band with the freedom to create and perform without boundaries. Unhindered by the confines of standard music compositions, ego and expectations the two have forged a crunchy, melodic style of music thats heavily influenced by the post-rock/metal sound. Early on, during the initial conception of The Leshen, the members opted to eschew vocals and leaned heavily on the use of swirling, layered guitar effects incorporated with noise and sound samples in live performances to create an immersive experience that encourages the listener to draw their own conclusion and story for each song.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/MVIMG_20180827_204148.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0BblcGa2Sn7OwOVvfFcE0M?si=nElDeVSqQtW_c7GlYIGH1A" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/theleshen/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.theleshen.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">The Kity Project</h2><h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3><p class="artist">Ty and Kim met in 2011 and rapidly fell in love through music. After moving to Hawaii and playing in a blues rock band for several years, the duo moved back to mainland USA and traveled the contiguous 48 in search of a new home and a place to begin pursuing their musical dreams. On the long journey to Colorado in a beat up camper van, The Kity Project was born, initially with just Kim and Tyler. It has since evolved and now manifests as a four piece ensemble. The Kity Project is currently wrapping up studio time, where they just recorded their 3 track EP to be released as a predecessor to a full-length, live tracked album. The band is also planning their spring and fall tour which will include live music in Fort Collins, Denver, Boulder, Longmont, Windsor, and hopefully Wyoming and Montana. In January 2019, the band was featured on Radio 94.9&#39;s special &#34;Local&#39;s Lounge&#34;, and they also have many plans of taking part in many smaller charity events this year... taking pride in their ability to adapt their sound to fit the venue. Whether rocking out larger indoor venues/festivals or performing an acoustic set in the park, The Kity Project delivers.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/32955508_1856914197662448_7801150095604318208_n.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DU33uoLvhU" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/theKITYproject/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

Danish born brothers, Jakob and Oliver Mueller, provide the vocal and guitar backdrop for Slow Caves, a band (rounded out by childhood friends David Dugan - guitar/bass, and Jackson Lamperes - drums) who offer a relaxed and surf-y update on 80s synth, 90s jangle, and early aughts indie rock. Formed in Ft. Collins, CO in 2014, Slow Caves quickly gained a reputation as a must-see local attraction. Soon the band was making an impression in Denvers vibrant music scene, earning slots at tastemaker clubs such as The Hi Dive and Lost Lake Lounge. In 2015, the band showcased their music at SXSW in Austin and CMJ in New York. Then in late 2016, the band signed with Cincinnati-based Old Flame Records (Cloud Nothings, Dead Confederate), performed at Boises lauded, Treefort Festival and Austins&#39; SXSW (March 2017), and released their Old Flame debut (Desert Minded-EP) on March 10, 2017.

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Mama Lenny and the Remedy</h2><h3 class="artist">R&B-Soul-Funk</h3><p class="artist">Hot, tight, and sassy, Mama Lenny and the Remedy recalls the tradition of the sexy, soulful songbird backed by a band that looks as good as it sounds. Fronted by the startling vocal and emotional power of Laniece Schleicher, they deliver a high-energy, bold fusion of soul, funk, rock, blues, and disco with shrewd hints of jazz, gospel, and Broadway. With infectious energy, the band delves into the joys and downfalls of love and life, and the sensual pleasures and saucy self-possession that sustain us through it always with a wink of humor and a witty turn of phrase. The band is an impeccable synergy of driving rhythms, astute instrumentation, and compelling harmonies that Scene Magazine calls unstoppable collaborative chemistry.? It is composed of some of Northern Colorados musical all-stars; Crip Erickson (drums) and Ben Prytherch (bass) deliver a broad rhythmic vocabulary, from smooth and groovy to hot and hell-bent. Greta Cornett (trumpet), Annie Sklar (saxaphone), Kenneth Monks (guitar), and Kelly Keeler (backing vocals) add cunning punch and texture, creating a rich, bold sound that often verges on the experimental. Since their start in 2011, Mama Lenny and the Remedy have played some of the most celebrated venues in Northern Colorado and Wyoming. They have opened for internationally renowned acts Alison Kraus and the Union Station, The California Honeydrops, JC Brooks and the Uptown Sound, and the English Beat, and are widely recognized as one of Colorados breakout bands.

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Cowboys Dead</h2><h3 class="artist">Cover-Tribute</h3><p class="artist">Cowboys Dead plays the music of Marty Robbins, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Jimmy Reed, Don Nix, Merle Haggard, New Riders, Rolling Stones, Peter Rowan and more...in the spirit of the Grateful Dead. With a passion for the sound of Dead in the early 70s, Cowboys Dead reaches deep into the the Dead&#39;s repertoire, bringing to today&#39;s audiences great Pig Pen era tunes such as Smokestack Lightning, Mr. Charlie, Alligator and It Hurts Me Too. Cowboys Dead founder and lead guitarist, Dave Dardine, came up with the name from a bootleg Grateful Dead LP with the same name. The Cowboy&#39;s Dead LP was recorded live at Harpur, May 2, 1970. The set list from that show became a loose road map for the band, on a road with no signs or dividing lines and very few rules to guide. &#34;Cowboys Dead&#34; is also a tip of the hat to the late, great &#34;Cowboy&#34; Neal Cassady, the larger-than-life man who infamously was at the wheel and whose ineffable spirit lives on in the writings of Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsburg and Ken Kesey, and certainly in the music of the Grateful Dead. The core band consists of Dave Dardine on lead guitar and vocals, Ken Duran on rhythm guitar and vocals, Doug Salmon on bass guitar, Ed Anderson on vocals and harp, and Dave White on drums.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/20190111_230302-01.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXOP6Qd-LSk" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/cowboysdead" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.cowboysdead.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">New Ben Franklins</h2><h3 class="artist">Country-Bluegrass-Americana</h3><p class="artist">In speaking with David DeVoe, principle songwriter and singer of New Ben Franklins, he will tell you that the band has always been about sonicness?. While this term may pique your curiosity and cause you to ponder its exact meaning, one has to go no further than New Ben Franklins latest full length release What Happens When Things Fall Apart to experience the NBF sonic experience. The shimmering cascade of sharp guitars is anchored by clean and driving bass lines, as well as the pleasing, throbbing rumble of drums on tunes like the title track and Regrets?. For those who have come to love DeVoes exploration of the country music that embedded itself deep within his mind and heart while he was growing up, there are songs with galloping rhythms and a familiar Southwestern twang; Home? and Better Man?. And by the time you reach Burning from the Inside?, you may truly understand the term sonicness?; the way that all of these influences and sounds mesh and coalesce to create the New Ben Franklins&#39; signature sound. The band has played under the New Ben Franklins moniker since 1992, and there have been several changes in lineup as the music has evolved, but the lodestone of the band has always been David DeVoe. Tom Murphy of Westword described DeVoe&#39;s vocals as ...never tentative. He always sounds like he has something intense to say, even when waxing poetic about everyday struggles.? The smooth, clear tenor of his voice, coupled with the unwavering bass lines of Jeremy Ziehe, provide the anchor around which the lead guitar, played by Bobby Taylor, can swirl or chop or twang as necessary. Behind the drum kit is John Dennis, propelling the songs forward like a freight train and bringing a rumble to the music that the drum machine of 1992 never could. New Ben Franklins live shows bring their sonicness? full circle. Whether playing a festival such as the FoCoMX or Westword Music showcase, or honky-tonking at the Skylark Lounge, youre bound to get an earful. DeVoe will be the first person to call the live show noisy,? but that doesnt tell you about how youll feel when youre rocking along with the band, awash in distorted guitars one moment and then in the very next moment swaying to the jangling telecaster he plays as though it were your oldest dance partner. And noisy? definitely does not describe the annual toe-tapping tribute that the band arranges to honor the late Waylon Jennings; that show is straight up country gold. Waylon Jennings would be proud of New Ben Franklins. As the Nashville Rebel himself might say, they have things to do, and things to say, in their own way.?<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/recordshop3.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4uXmYCPjOi4qeSFz58zzYw?si=1H2CD3ebT1ahJeFeP95X0w" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://facebook.com/newbenfranklins" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.newbenfranklins.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">The Symbols</h2><h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3><p class="artist">The Symbols are a popular female-fronted blues/funk/rock trio from Fort Collins, Colorado. Formed in 2011 by guitarist Jasco (former guitar player for Grammy-nominated Blinddog Smokin&#39;) and vocalist/songwriter/bassist Mer Sal, The Symbols are centered around a dynamic musical and life partnership. They write their own music, in addition to writing arrangements of known tunes, to be different sounds and styles than they were intended. Their unique sound, charisma, and songs are winning hearts through theaters and festivals across the country. The Symbols formed in a melting pot of blues-rock, urban funk, motown roots, and soul revival, spending every night possible in the Denver blues, funk, and rock scenes during the band&#39;s formation. Early on, Jasco and Mer Sal discovered that with both of their diverse musical backgrounds, they could perform for several different audiences. The Symbols began to perform across the west and midwest with many cool players in the Blues/Funk/Rock genres after talent buyers at major festivals in Colorado began to notice The Symbols&#39; subtle innovations. The Symbols perform 150 dates a year, across Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, California, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. The Symbols received the 2017 Holley Award for &#34;Best Arranger&#34; from the Colorado Blues Society (CBS). In addition, The Symbols represented the Mile High Blues Society (MHBS) in Memphis, TN in January of 2018 for the International Blues Challenge (IBC), making it to the semi-finals. The Symbols were featured on the cover of Scene Magazine in December of 2016, with a feature article inside. In February of 2018, a featured interview with Mer Sal was released in Bass Musicians Magazine (The Face of Bass). The Symbols have shared the stage - opening and sometimes sitting in - with many national acts, like Danielle Nicole Band, Samantha Fish, Miss Blues, Southern Avenue Band, Jason Ricci and the Bad Kind, Vixen, Tommy Castro, and more!While staying in the realm of modern female blues acts, The Symbols try to bring their own definitions to what may be considered the blues. The Symbols&#39; sound is also reminiscent of a range of millennial influences like Jeff Beck Group, Sheryl Crow, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Amy Winehouse, and The Red Hot Chili Peppers.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/31376224_10216324916496219_6635762469895667712_o.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/32MZ7PcX83JqUjTkjpCpGm?si=eKAODZcYTp22giahouhojw" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thesymbols" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.thesymbols.net" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

Tom met guitarist Pierce Hansen during their time as students at the University of Wyoming, where they would perform together as The Omaha Boys. After several relocations separated The Omaha Boys for a few years, Tom and Pierce both ended up in Fort Collins and in 2016 reformed The Omaha Boys. After discussing adding a rhythm section, they decided to form a new project. ? Tom met double bassist Jo Asker at their job in Fort Collins. Jo became familiar with Tom and Pierce after attending a few Omaha Boys shows, and accepted their proposal to form a full band with Jo on double bass. Jo and drummer Matt Brown were well acquainted through their time as CSU music students and gigging jazz musicians. Jo introduced Matt to Tom and Pierce as a potential drummer for the project, and after a jam session in April 2017, Buck Wilde was born.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/BuckWildepromo.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/46OxI57N59H8Ek0uuvN8Ax?si=9ngLbDyYQkWGqFZh5gdGhw" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BuckWildeMusic" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.buckwildemusic.com/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">The Lollygags</h2><h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3><p class="artist">While they certainly arent a tribute band, at their core the Lollygags are a tribute to a love for surreal and irreverent comedy, loud guitars, hilariously bad movies, bedroom rock-poster admiration, and the kind of pop culture ephemera that resonates between deep initiates of nerd lore. The bands music is not derivative of any flavor of rock n roll except maybe to call it power pop infused with the spirit of punk rock. That puts it in a similar vein as the Replacements, unabashed adorers of the Smithereens, and the Modern Lovers. Taking inspiration also from The Stones and The Who at their most loose and free. The Lollygags are a not a jam band either. But as singer/guitarist Jonathan Snyder has said a band who likes to jam? - as in at times being willing to give in to the spirit of the moment. Theyve been known to go off the map of their own established recordings. What is rock and roll without rebellion even within your own music? The name the Lollygags refers to Snyders creative process, driven by inspiration of the moment resulting in writing a few songs a year rather than marathon songwriting sessions and stretching the quality thin. Along with Canadian bassman Ryk Bonus the two go out and experience inspiration themselves in live music, live comedy and living itself to replenish their creative drive. And that shared fandom is what has fueled the Lollygags since 2011 - the music is about us rather than merely them.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/Lollygags.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/78AuISuU3RYXvOYkRhftGP?si=WG26st6FRJioWJ52grg5jQ" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/thelollygags" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.thelollygags.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Halleway</h2><h3 class="artist">Indie-Alternative</h3><p class="artist">Halleway is a Indie rock project out of Denver, Colorado. The band is comprised of Patrick Armould, Jake Patterson, Alex Jackson, and Riley Odonnell. Listening to Halleways earnest and heartfelt lyrics centered around love and heartbreak, its hard to believe that these gifted musicians are just at the beginning of their career. The group has been making music for just over one year ? this past year being a gateway to their success. Halleways single, Found,? was released last summer and blew up seemingly overnight. It has now reached over 100,000 streams on Spotify. Soon after, the band headlined the Lost Lake Lounge in August and performed a string of sold-out shows in Denver supporting popular acts like The Ballroom Thieves, Houndmouth. They began touring as both headliners and a supporting act for Joe Pug. November saw the release of their debut EP, Little Mans World, at a sold-out headlining show at the Globe Hall. 303 Magazine said &#34;theyve already achieved a timeless sound that takes some bands years to find. Its looking like 2019 is going to be a busy year for the artists.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/IMG_3477-nwotwzctps8ud5pnovacolt5b5mtchslgywsqlt5dc.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/20XYQ7MJh9Ayd3fpr0Bb7n?si=o9DkAfvEQUGelrW1Qu_3-Q" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hallewayband/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://hallewayband.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

In his work as a performer and a composer, Smiley focuses on developing systems and modes of playing at the nexus of composition and improvisation that reference elements of established American vernacular and experimental music traditions, while simultaneously and idiosyncratically deviating from them. His multifaceted and studied approach to both the bass and composition enable an adroit facility in both idiomatic and non-idiomatic settings.

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Nancy Just</h2><h3 class="artist">Singer-Songwriter</h3><p class="artist">Singer-songwriter Nancy Just&#39;s second album, ALCHEMIZED, produced by songwriter multi-instrumentalist Justin Roth, is inspired by the resiliency of the human spirit and by the ability of the human soul to transcend pain and suffering. ALCHEMIZED illuminates love, loss, hope, redemption, spirituality, addiction, healing, and soul freedom. While making the record, Roth came to refer to ALCHEMIZED as &#34;prophetic&#34; as it foreshadowed many events in Nancy&#39;s life that would unknowingly come to fruition. Some of the songs are retrospective (coming from past experience), while others are fictitious, where inspiration and imagination pave the way to new ideas. In this case, the potency behind the songs prophetically and uncannily come from the past, present, and future at the same time, mirroring events in Nancy&#39;s personal life that would become actualized. The album became more poignant and synchronistic as events in her life unfolded. Inspired by numerous artists, predominately Lana del Rey&#39;s &#34;Tropico&#34; and Mazzy Star, Nancy&#39;s vision for this record was to be lyrically and sonically cinematic, deeply poetic, and mimic &#34;real life&#34;. Rooted with her vulnerable lyrics, her ethereal and at times haunting vocals, her music beckons the listener to lean in, as if she&#39;s sharing aloud our own Tarot card reading, in which each of our fate&#39;s may be mutually entwined. The songs range from the intimate &#34;Catch and Release&#34; and the driving &#34;Urban Warrior&#34; to the anthemic &#34;Freedom&#34;. These incantations rest on a bed of Roth&#39;s lush multi-layered electric guitars and textural landscapes, along with the echoes of clanking bottles, the swooshing of cars driving by, and the pacing of boots on a wooden floor, to sonically zoom us in and takes us there. Shamanic and mystical elements are woven throughout ALCHEMIZED as Nancy has been drawn to the metaphysical since she was an adolescent. ALCHEMIZED reflects how we can be transformed and transcend our pain through our spiritual practices and experiences. Even though parts of the album are deeply personal, even more so, they are universal. The strength that underlies Nancy&#39;s lyricism and vulnerability is humanly relatable and stunningly intimate, resulting in a deeply moving listening experience. The album is dedicated to her two boys and their late father, who unexpectedly died while the album was being recorded. Deepening the significance of the symbolism and potency of the record, Nancy&#39;s brother unexpectedly died four months later from a drug overdose. Recording ALCHEMIZED was a sacred and deeply moving process for her as the songs themselves enabled her to transcend her own heavy lead into gold.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/IMG_5755.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5uEycW30UILJvKlJ0xt98U?si=k1YMVcQNTuO9ZE0TP3eJVw" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

D.W. spent his summers in Cape Breton Island surrounded by the Atlantic ocean. D.W. encapsulates his music by the natural environments of the seas, forests, and hills in which his debut record &#34;As I Roam Across A Dark Blue Night&#34; is largely inspired by. Mainly a punk rock musician throughout his early teens, D.W. found his inspiration for folk and blues music through first listening to Tom Waits while traveling through Death Valley with his father. Eventually finding comfort in playing as a one man band. D.W. found some chains on the side of the road which he wraps around his left foot to stomp. An old 1950&#39;s racing stripe suitcase, and an anvil made from a railroad track.. His music is from the heart of ghost towns, howling trains, and seeking peace and redemption by the riverside. D.W. has been lucky enough to share the stage with Charlie Parr, The Hooten Hallers, Grant Sabin and The Juke Joint High Ball, AJ Fullerton, and was welcomed aboard The Durango Blues Train to play live blues on a moving Steam Engine Train in 2018. D.W. is on his way to releasing his new EP this year in 2019. Press Quotes: &#34;D.W. Doucet is a one-man-band with a homegrown, finger-picking, country blues style featuring slide guitar, banjo and a bellowing dark and heartfelt howl. D.W. carries with him a 1950&#39;s racing stripe suitcase, an anvil made from a railroad track that he pummels with an old blacksmith hammer, and chains stomping on his left foot.

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">King Crawdad</h2><h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3><p class="artist">King Crawdad instills emotion, sincerity, and feeling into our rock and roll music. We perform with intense effort and energy at all times. We leave every inch of ourselves on stage after each performance. We provide a unique blend of garage rock, punk rock, and alternative rock that energizes listeners. We use heartfelt and emotional lyrics to express our sound and to try to provide a raw and real musical experience. King Crawdad was formed in 2005 by Miles Mercer and Nick Perich, who were also members of a band called the Varmints at the time. We have developed a strong musical bond and our chemistry has evolved in each of the 13 years we have played together. 2018 has been our best year as a band as we have continued to perform everywhere we can and recorded our first quality EP with our long time producer Jason Larson. We were able to capture our sound in an amazing moment where guitar, vocals, and drums were recorded in singular live takes. We only overdubbed bass and one additional background vocal for one song. We take pride in being able to create a raw, live feel for these recordings that truly captures our sound<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/31768643_10155362011910933_3416658978027864064_n.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=81738612/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/KingCrawdad" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

The band focuses on making music about positivity, celebrating life even when life is hard, and smiling til your cheeks hurt. Dont be surprised when Amys heartfelt lyrics and captivating vocals leave you wanting more. Music is Amys outlet. It is what gets her through the day, and believes most people can relate to that. Writing and performing music has enabled Amy to put into words the pains she endured, whether it was an abusive relationship, or a betrayed friendship, to the joy she feels when looking at her three children and the family shes been blessed with. Music gives us a way to relate to other people, to let them know that Hey. Youre not alone. No matter how hopeless you feel, keep going - because tomorrow will come.? Scene Magazine agrees, with their review of our self titled debut: The lyrics are often personal and are seemingly always accompanied with a message of optimism.? Amy started out as a solo artist, and in the winter of 2014, turned to her longtime friend, Chad Wickham (Bass), to form a band. Amy and the Peace Pipes are rounded out with Jeromey Balderrama (Drums), and John Russell (Guitar). Amy says, of her band, These guys are my Peace Pipes. They make the magic happen, and I am so thankful to have the privilege to not only share the stage with them but my songs as well. I couldnt do this without them.? Since their formation, Amy and the Peace Pipes has established themselves throughout northern Colorado, playing shows across the front range. Last fall the band released Edens Favorite Apple, their first full-length album release, following up on their self-titled EP released in 2015, and their Burning Bridges? single released in 2017. The sophomore CD represents the band solidifying its unique piano-rock/reggae/alternative sound while promoting the realization of inner-beauty, self-worth, conquering adversity and embracing the optimism that lies in the unknown.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/AatPP-Album-GroupPic1.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0HsSHFhn3OZpVr43Jvu3Df?si=7f1_Lx1tQFmcKkFOHO7SnQ" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://facebook.com/amyandthepeacepipes" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="https://amyandthepeacepipes.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

Inspired by &#39;80s chick rock as a musician coming of age, she developed an affinity for folk music in her adulthood. These two influences are apparent in Sasha Stone Band&#39;s unique identity as an electric folk band. Sasha considers herself a diamond in the rough and encourages her listeners to persevere with resilience through life&#39;s turbulence as she shares vulnerable, image-rich lyrics that detail her personal triumphs over abuse, loss and poverty. She reminds her fans, &#34;My writing comes from a place of despair at times but in the end, the message is always the same. Just try to hold on. You are not alone. You have got this.&#34; Accompanied by Tyler Thompson on lead guitar, Dave Noonan on bass, and Mason Bassuk on drums and backup vocals, Sasha Stone Band has evolved since its inception in 2015. Based in Fort Collins, the band performs regularly in Northern Colorado and Wyoming, in addition to playing festivals, weddings, and parties.

Every song is emotionally driven while persuading even the most timid to get on their feet and dance it out. &#34;We are so thankful for the opportunity, week after week, to do what we love with the people we love the most.

We have spent the last three years in continual redefinition of these principles.. ANIMAL object is an ever evolving project in every way and no two shows are alike. We spend time apart building new instruments to bring to the table and ask about new ideas with each new opportunity. We strive to create a truly moving and unexpected direction with live shows and present a new awareness within hearing and even cooperating with music in the live venue. We've had the great pleasure of playing with a litany of notable local and international touring improvisors and have gleaned many new ideas from sharing with those that share our creative passion.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/0000_COVER.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3694742096/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/AnimalObject" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="https://bangsnap.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">The Wendy Woo Band</h2><h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3><p class="artist">Wendy Woo Look away, dont let the sun burn your eyes. Dont let the snow touch your skin? - The Immigrant Wendy Woo has been exposed to the unexpected in life. As the daughter of immigrant bohemian parents who were founding faculty members at Naropa University in Colorado, growing up in the family home was a true eclectic social center. Visitors such as Allen Ginsberg, Merry Prankster, Ken Kesey and Norman Mailor would be regulars in the living room. So when Wendy sat down to write a song reflecting on all this, it had to be sweet and humorous. &#34;One Way Ticket,&#34; is a nod to growing up as a &#34;beatnik&#39;s kid,&#34; and Gregory Corso teaching her how to play poker. Cause one always needs to have a good poker face. Summers on the back porch, Gregory teaching his kids to play poker. Poetry, albums and wine. - One Way Ticket Woo started to play guitar at 18 to accompany herself and was soon writing songs and performing in songwriting circles. She attended the University of New Mexico as well as the University of Colorado, where she studied various musical genres, theory and composition. Her musical influences draw from the folk chanteuse Suzanne Vega to legendary Paul Simon. The blending rhythms in Simons music made her pay attention to it in her writings. Woos dexterous music works its way into your consciousness like an Edward Hopper painting or a shot of smooth rum.  - Kristen Sherwood, www.csindy.com As Woos prowess grew she developed a technique she calls Slaptap.? She transforms her body and guitar as one percussion instrument. She hits and slaps at various point of the acoustic guitar creating a performance art piece. The fluid movement between her hands and body keep the viewer focused throughout the song. While working at The Fox Theatre in Boulder, she began to spread her wings as a performer and develop her people skills to promote herself. The venue was supportive by giving her opening slots to the incoming headliners as well as playing around town. Some of the national acts she opened up for were Sheryl Crow, Counting Crows, James Taylor and Carly Simon. Wendys DIY mindset would come in handy one day when she won the Colorado Lilith Fair Talent Search in 1999, which led to her share the stage with an elite lineup that included Sarah McLaughlin, Indigo Girls, Shawn Colvin and Sheryl Crow. She wowed them with her songs and voice. Michael Roberts, a longtime Colorado music critic, explains it perfectly,  - her vocals exude a sensuality that&#39;s unexpectedly subtle.? Woo has recorded more than 100 original songs, plays up to 200 dates a year and operating her own musical empire called WooMusic. The company is based out of Loveland, CO where her staff works on all facets of her career. She has been placed in the Westword Hall of Fame after winning the weekly papers Best Artist Award five times. As her personal life grew to three kids and a husband; the whole life in motion notion gives way to total bliss for songstress. After 20 years as being a true independent musician, 12 albums, countless live shows and meeting fans, Wendy Woos life continues to be unexpected.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/Woo_15Woo_15_0850.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3ryolqUgM28gW7K4jmgIrr?si=gXvM6yqrSmqZFPCfBD0DUA" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/thewendywooband" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.wendywoo.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

But if jukeboxes were still a thing, they&#39;d be livin&#39; there. And though the Jukes don&#39;t wear bathrobes to gigs, you might want a nice comfy one to slip into after a night of dancing and grooving to the rock-solid liquid-filled center of this horn-driven band! Coming off their biggest gigging year yet (including the past several at FoCoMX) FoCo&#39;s best-kept secret band has been making surgical strikes at beloved venues including Equinox Brewing, the Colorado Room, and private parties bringing the gospel of soul, blues and rock to audiences that have been dancing with abandon and yelling for more. With a mix of solid originals and old favorites, every night the Jukes play, it&#39;s a journey of joy, groove and abandon.

A little over a year ago, the band&#39;s future was questionable, as drummer Ian Webb went under the knife to take care of an aneurysm located near his heart.

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Audible (weareaudible)</h2><h3 class="artist">Hip Hop-Rap</h3><p class="artist">Audible is a Colorado Springs based 5-piece band intent on raising the bar for Colorado hip-hop - the group is equally well suited sharing the stage with the likes of Murs and Warren G or Robert Randolph and everything in between. From humble beginnings in 2012 to features on nationally syndicated radio shows in 2018, Audible has been on a wild ride. When HoTT and Jeb started the project, they wanted to create music that appealed to the masses but could also satisfy the minority. Their unique tone does just that. The same year Audible was formed, Brandon, Ryan and Kyrt gave birth to the rock band SOUND|STUDIES - in 2017, they combined forces with Audible and became the backbone of the group. Audible&#39;s sound is an amalgamation of funk, jazz, soul, melodic rock and golden era boom-bap - they are not your typical hip-hop. In 2018 Audible submitted a song to the NPR Tiny Desk Contest - the band was chosen to play the Tiny Desk Showcase in Denver and other amazing opportunities such as a live performance in the CPR Open Air studio. After the Denver showcase, Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton featured the band on their show All Songs Considered and made flattering statements like - &#34;Lyrically, they were truly inspiring&#34; and &#34;Very hot band, really great players.&#34; Whether you prefer carefully crafted, conscious lyricism or solid musicianship and tight grooves, this group delivers. Audible has spent the last two years writing, recording and performing, and plan to introduce their upcoming EP - First Contact, in the spring of 2019.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/DSC_4917.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Urz7GZQuecs" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WeareAudible/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.weareaudible.net" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

The band hit the studio, recording their debut album Snowdrift. The album pays homage to the natural world through songs about seeds that become trees, the relationship between the ocean and the moon, the formation of rain drops, and bioluminescent creatures. Pictures of Moss is currently working on their follow up album.

His acoustic-style songs, with melodies ranging from mellow to upbeat, are marked by characteristic lyrical vulnerability. Though he attended piano lessons from a young age, Ian did not find his true instrumental passion until his 18-year- old self picked up a guitar. Ians high school and college years were spent exploring music in the form of countless different bands, ultimately, establishing himself as a solo artist in 2008.

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Big Brooklyn</h2><h3 class="artist">World-Reggae-Latin</h3><p class="artist">A finalist in the 2018 John Lennon Songwriting Contest for their song One Provision?, Big Brooklyns original compositions, as well as their adaptations of klezmer, jazz, and rock standards, captivate audiences with a unique depth of passion in expressive melodies and harmonies, touching on on the inseparable exultation and pathos of the klezmer sound, all interwoven over a fabric of jazz and groove. Bridging jazz, klezmer, rock, and groove, this five-piece group carries a progressive yet inviting presence, exploring beautiful melodies while defining new boundaries. Big Brooklyn was formed in 2014 by Willie and Melody Dornfeld. Having both been involved in music for a long time, they wanted to create a group where they took freedom to write music they love, that spoke to their hearts, that was passionate and all-out, and which brought together different styles in which they had been immersed. Melody Dornfeld began classical music studies at a young age, studying with Dr. Ramon Kireilis, principal clarinetist of the Colorado Springs Symphony Orchestra, and later the esteemed and highly-recorded Andrew Marriner, principal clarinetist of the London Symphony Orchestra and of The Academy of St. Martin in the Field. In high school she took first place in the Colorado Springs Youth Symphony Young Artists Competition, being noted by the Colorado Springs Gazette for the depth of emotion? with which she played. Her love of music continued to flourish at the University of Denvers Lamont School of Music where she first met Willie and took first place in the Lamont Honors Competition, performing as a soloist with the Lamont Symphony Orchestra. She was also awarded the Lamont School of Musics Junior Recital of the Year? award, was named the University of Denvers 2000-2001 Presser Scholar as the outstanding junior musician of the year, and graduated as the University of Denvers Most Outstanding Senior in Performance. While her classical studies expanded and enhanced her technical skills, Melody yearned for another level of freedom of expression and creativity. She began studying jazz improvisation at Lamont with Lynn Baker. During her junior year she attended a klezmer performance given by a clarinetist and made a soul-connection. Feeling an instant and providential connection, she undertook a Partners In Scholarship Research Project titled The Art of Klezmer Music? where she travelled internationally, attended camps, and studied with internationally renowned klezmer and jazz clarinetist, David Krakauer. Music has always been a magnet for Willie Dornfeld. He studied with New Englands in-demand drummer Ric Hadad and spent countless hours of time in deep connection practicing, performing, and venturing through rock, blues, and funk with some his favorite buddies in early years. While resonating with rock and blues, he was also growing in his love of and skills in jazz. Willie headed to Colorado and studied with Mike Marlier, Paul Romaine, and John Kinzie earning his Bachelor of Music degree in Jazz Studies Performance from the University of Denver. Willie has played in numerous venues and theatres throughout Colorado, traveling up and down the front range, playing in mountain ski towns, and logging studio time. Big Brooklyn is named after a cliff on an inactive granite quarry in Branford where Willie and his friends spent many hours swimming while growing up. And, yes, it was big! The Colorado-based band began to take shape as Willie and Melody were joined by other fantastic musicians. Tenor sax player Luke Soasey joined them first, an amazing student of sax, well-versed in jazz, and an active performer. Luke studied with many teachers, including John Gross, Rob Scheps, Charley Gray, Darrell Grant, Allan Jones, Bob Mover, David Valdez, David Friesen, Stefon Harris, among others. Aaron Summerfield joined next, a masterful guitarist, comfortable in any genre, from playing a sweet ballad to soloing in free and chaotic sections, and able to play passionately while instantly technically navigating the simple and the complex. Aaron earned his Masters of Music degree at the University of Denver where he was the jazz departments Outstanding Graduate Student.? Aaron is a full-time active performer, composer, and college music educator in Denver, Colorado. Finally, Jo Asker joined the group on bass. Jo earned his Master of Music in double bass performance from Colorado State University and performs widely in the classical and jazz worlds with such groups as the Erik Bowen Trio, the Twirling Zucchini Trio, the Mood Elevators, the Modern Art Duo, the Palouse Choral Society Festival Orchestra, the Idaho Bach Festival Orchestra, the Mood Elevators, the Twirling Zucchini Trio, Mark Sloniker, and many more. Jo is also a music educator, teaching double bass at two different colleges. While thriving in live performance, Big Brooklyn released their first album, Purpose,this year, having the opportunity to work with Denvers master recording engineer, Colin Bricker at Mighty Fine Productions, who has also recorded artists such as Ron Miles, Brian Blade, Bill Frisell, and Dave Liebman. Their music has been well-received. Serious talent in an eclectic and unique package.? -Avogadros Number, Live Music Venue With a sound that laughs and sobs at the same time, Dornfeld on clarinet is a master of nuance. Her reed is her tongue, joy is her language and this CD as a collaboration of these outstanding musicians is a supernova.? -Debbie Burke, Jazz Author/Journalist The clarinet is used incredibly well, and both hits notes spot on and deliberately slinks up to them, showing very different techniques and lip control, adding a slightly laid back feel. Lazy Environment? is worth many listens for Melody Dornfields [sic] clarinet playing, let alone the rest of Big Brooklyn. Sumptuous.? -Sammy Stein, Jazz Reviewer, Something Else Reviews<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/BigBrooklynBandPic.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/410393232&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bigbrooklynmusic/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.bigbrooklynmusic.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Attack On Venus</h2><h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3><p class="artist">Attack on Venus is your local pissed off galactic explorers. With the latest release of the album XO they explore new territory. XO is a fairly short release that focuses on bringing you along their journey. If you have listened to Attack on Venus live it is very much a sonic exploration, however this EP directs you more towards structure and catchy hooks with an occasion sonic bloom. Album Youth? is a bit of a trickster, a somewhat robotic chant of sorts sets a subtle dark tone for the release. The album it really hits on track two with Rockets.? The song encompasses Attack in a well-rounded manner and is one of the highlights of the EP. Much darker in tone with a large eerie guitar landscape and guitar solo, the track provides a nice broad scope of musical influence to shine through and really grabs the listener. The band takes an interesting approach lyrically throughout the tracks. It is very hard to make a solid decision on what perspective the lyrics are coming from. Is the singer Alan Hlavacek rationalizing to himself, speaking to the listener, or is the story directed at him? The somewhat ambiguous vocal style leads to an interesting vibe throughout the EP. The third track on the list is Tape on Rewind.? The most grounded track is very fittingly the most relatable. Filled with self-doubt and uncertainty of past decisions, it is an introspective song that can be applied to so many walks of life. With a slight grin Attack on Venus close the EP with Radiation,? a fairly aggressive track with social and political under tones sprinkled throughout. It leaves the listener in a dissonant void and bludgeons them with heavy riffs. Overall the EP is short and sweet and is definitely something every local rocker, punk, and metalhead should have in their regular rotation. -Samm Barrett<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/aov1.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3ITFSnrUzrOfzeojiS39fe?si=eulz5F01QuKWseDLVbmGfw" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/attackonvenus" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/attack-on-venus" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

He has seriously dug into the local music scene as of late with the bluegrass band Lineage, fronting the band at various venue in and around Fort Collins, including Washington&#39;s, Aggie Theater, The Swing Station, and as well as numerous bars, breweries and private events. Crowl is the main songwriter and lead singer in Lineage and he takes a handle on lead and rhythm acoustic guitar.

She draws from the traditions of Folk, Bluegrass, Americana, Country, and Rock and Roll, but especially likes to seek inspiration from the musical stories and lives of Colorado seniors living in care facilities. Hanna plays full time in nursing homes and senior centers as well as in venues, bars, and on the road, trying to create more connections between the music worlds of the old and the young and between historical songs and those being produced today. In 2017, after becoming deeply infatuated with the history of American country music, Hanna began writing country and folk inspired songs of her own. She&#39;s enjoyed exploring and becoming part of a genre that, for better or worse, has a very rich history and more than a little bit of baggage to be unpacked. She hopes that as she continues to make music that she can somehow manage to capture all of the stories of the wise, to bring some enjoyment and spark to all of the folks, and to break down some stereotypes in the process.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/jb-detour-64.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/537479025&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/HannaDoreenMusic/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.johannabrownmusic.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">The Gabrielle Louise Band</h2><h3 class="artist">Acoustic-Folk</h3><p class="artist">Gabrielle Louise is a nationally touring troubadour noted for her poignant lyrics and lush voice. The daughter of two vagabond musicians, Gabrielle inherited the predisposition to wanderlust and song. Gabrielle Louise&#39;s music is anchored deeply in folk and Americana, but undeniably drawn to rich harmonies and melodic adventurism. Her sound has the earthy feel of early Joni Mitchell while also veering into the spirited and versatile delivery of fellow genre-hopping artist Eva Cassidy. Unafraid to take a musical escapade in the name of inspiration, Gabrielle is at one moment folkie and ethereal, the next a smoky jazz chanteuse. Known for her authenticity and candor on stage, Gabrielle&#39;s performances are notably present and sincere, a professional presentation of her private creative world. Her story-telling and banter envelopes and enchants, gently enticing her listener to release their grip on the status quo. Perhaps because of this quality, Louise has been entrusted to share the stage with greats such as Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, Joan Osborne, Eliza Gilkyson, and Guy Clark. A poet, painter, prose writer and orator, Gabrielle has also presented a talk on autobiographical expression at TEDx, an independently organized TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) event. Her talk, &#34;The Breath of Experience,&#34; discusses her philosophies on accessing creativity and therapy via autobiography and storytelling. In the original songwriting realm, Louise has released a handful of records, the most recent of which were Mirror the Branches (2010), The Bird in My Chest (2014), If the Static Clears (2016) and Live at Etown Hall (2018)<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/Gabrielle-Louise-Vertical3-Color-Mark-Sink-medium.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/276412021&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheGabrielleLouiseShow" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.gabriellelouise.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">Luna Shade</h2><h3 class="artist">World-Reggae-Latin</h3><p class="artist">Luna Shade began as an Acoustic reggae duo between Jason Johnson and Andrew Kroneig from a mutual friendship in the northern Colorado music scene. After a few months, the project blossomed into a creative-driven endeavor, a collective brought together to bring a vibe people could relate with and feel serenity through expression among a life of troubled times and rocky waves. Andrew cites much of his musical inspiration from his unfortunate encounters with Hurricane Maria, Irma and other natural disasters from the 2017 Caribbean storms after being a resident of St. Croix. Preston Gray, Tyler O&#39;Hare & Ismael Mendoza were later added with that much needed extra musicality to bring a fuller sound to their original roots tunes.

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">f-ether</h2><h3 class="artist">Electronic-DJ</h3><p class="artist">With music as deeply connected to nature as the tree-laden mountains he calls home, Colorado musician f-ether has found a way to digitize the organic. But the concrete jungle has influenced his music just as powerfully, harboring a style all his own. Intricate drum patterns, prominent bass lines, and melodic arpeggiation are only a few spices in his flavor of electronic music, and he proudly displays his roots as a trip-hop producer when cooking up something new. f-ether has raised the eyebrows of musicians both locally and internationally through his diverse range of sounds. Not often after a show does the audience know how to classify his branch of electronic music, as it tends to be a mix of things they havent experienced before. This has led f-ether to take part in producers&#39; competitions around Denver and perform as a featured artist in local showcases. Although beat-influenced music and intricate compositions are where f-ether sharpens his edge, remixes are no daunting task to this producer. Having been previously recognized by A-Trak and Fool&#39;s Gold Records for his grand-prize winning remix in Grand Marniers 2015 #BlendOut competition, f-ether has gained traction as more than just another DJ? in the electronic and beat scenes. Local publications have even gone as far as calling him an experimental electronic dance music legend-in-the-making?, and his audiences have taken note of that as well (Tom Murphy, Queen City Sounds and Art). f-ether creates a unique live performance through use of his experience as a producer, DJ, songwriter, and lifelong instrumentalist. He bridges the gap between what is tangible and what is ethereal through a melodic portrayal of abstract ideology, complex emotions, and the human condition in a way that words simply cannot grasp. &#34;He&#39;s also an Emoji Wizard&#34; -Evergroove Studio<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/FETHER_YMH_web-13.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5b6BPE85iZQMnoHcdjOD7Q?si=qkzNx5EXRFaVAMh0D6cQtA" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://facebook.com/fethermusic" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://f-ether.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">The Seers</h2><h3 class="artist">Indie-Alternative</h3><p class="artist">A duo of Fort Collins natives Brian Collins and Sean Waters, the Seers create harmony-laden acoustic folk and indie rock. Pianist and vocalist Brian Collins has been blind from birth and started writing songs at the age of six. Sean Waters began playing music with Brian in high school. Their first band together, Wasabi, was voted Best Jam Band? by Denvers Westword (2007) and Best Jam Band? by the Fort Collins Musicians Association (2007 and 2008). In 2009, at the beginning of the end of Wasabi, Collins and Waters founded the Seers to experiment with stripped-down arrangements, singing, and songwriting. In 2010, they self-produced a lof-fi stream-of-consciousness EP, &#34;Universal Tree.&#34; In 2011, after getting 2nd place in the 2010 Scene Magazine Battle of the Bands, the Seers recorded and released &#34;Hydra,&#34; an electric guitar driven rock EP. They&#39;ve since release a string of self-released albums and EPs, working with local musicians and, among others, producer Danny Kalb, whose credits include Beck and Fierce Bad Rabbit. Playing over 100 shows a year since 2012, The Seers have earned the reputation of one of the hardest working bands in the region -- leaving audiences amazed with their repertoire and talents.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/36394535_10156437997874137_1277405647008169984_n.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3MOTBpAuBEMcZQhDwpEgY3?si=QtvgTOziTJW9ojLSw3w4sQ" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/theseers" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.theseersband.com" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

His primary band is Mama Lenny and the Remedy, but most of the songs he writes are too goofy or strange to be played in that band. So they are instead played by the Guardians of Earthly Delight: an often-changing lineup of musicians, most of whom are also members of Mama Lenny and the Remedy. Expect lots of dumb jokes, philosophical navel gazing in rhyming form, and key changes. The music is fairly catchy pop rock, but with enough weirdness to keep listeners stimulated.

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">The Burroughs</h2><h3 class="artist">R&B-Soul-Funk</h3><p class="artist">Steeped in classic soul standards and outfitted with modern flair, The Burroughs are a nine piece band with a powerhouse sound that has been electrifying audiences across Colorado and beyond. Since 2013, the band has lit up stages with their trademark brand of Sweaty Soul Music,? quickly earning their rightful place as one of the best live bands in the region. The Burroughs upcoming full-length studio album, Got To Feel, harnesses the energy of their live shows and combines it with thoughtful songwriting and superb musicianship to culminate in a new sonic frontier for the band. Produced and engineered by Colin Bricker of Mighty Fine Productions in Denver, CO, the album is due for worldwide release on January 9, 2018. In many ways, this is a coming of age album for the band,? says Johnny Burroughs, lead vocalist and bandleader. The identity of the band has finally come into focus as we have discovered who we are and locked in our sound.? Got To Feel thematically explores the ups and downs of navigating life and relationships amidst uncertainty, and finding clarity in a world full of noise. In life we cannot always control the circumstances in which we live, or the emotions that we feel,? explains Burroughs, but we can choose who we are when faced with those situations. We can feel anger and frustration, but choose to not be defined by them.? No newcomer to uplifting spirits, Johnny Burroughs works as a licensed minister and music pastor. His church upbringing serves him well on stage, where the red-headed frontman sings, dances, and screams audiences into a revival-like frenzy. His dynamite backing band includes a sizzling 4 piece horn section and tight 4 piece rhythm section that are as versatile as they are fun to watch. The bands live performances are capped by choreographed dancing, soaring solos, and funky grooves, with the goal of moving the audience to a joyful celebration by each shows closing tune. The Burroughs have played prestigious festivals and venues including Bohemian Nights New West Fest, The Block Party, The Greeley Blues Jam, Boulder International Film Festival, The Fox Theatre, Denver Day of Rock, The Aggie Theatre, The Underground Music Showcase, Ophelias Electric Soapbox, and The Fort Collins Music Experiment. The band has shared the stage with national acts that include The Steve Miller Band, ZAPP, The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Orgone, The Reminders, Southern Avenue, Lil Ed and the Blues Imperials, Walter Trout, and Samantha Fish. Previous recorded releases include the single You Are My Joy,? and b-side 1968?; and the full-length live album Sweaty Greeley Soul (Bandwagon Records), recorded live at the Moxi Theater. Since the bands start, The Burroughs have always embraced their hometown of Greeley, Colorado, with a passion for community outreach. Previous partnerships have amplified the work of great organizations like the Weld Food Bank, Greeley Boys and Girls Clubs, and Habitat for Humanity. The bands latest mission is an ongoing partnership with Greeley-Evans District 6 Schools to bring music education to students of all backgrounds. Providing music clinics and joint performances with high school bands around their city, The Burroughs hope to inspire the next generation of musicians to find a career path in music.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/the_burroughs.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3gd8BF5HW4fwPTdVU5oAuI?si=mT5XjlagQm6t-73lN-GWtg" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheBurroughsSoul/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.theburroughssoul.com/" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>

Whitewater Ramble effortlessly shifts scenery: just when you think youre nicely settled in on a hay bale at the hoedown, therell be a hint of Latin-flavored vibe eased into the mix  -  and then they flip the blinker on to make a hard left into Memphis - or throw on their RayBans and get all late-night jazzbo on you. - Relix Intense-funky-dance-grass is the most accurate description of Whitewater Ramble. It is not so easy to categorize this band, for they jam between distinct musical categories. Although one would believe impetuously that Whitewaters style is simply bluegrass, a closer listen shows it to be quite complex and varied. &#34;Hittin The Note&#34; Derek Siegel WWR have their feet planted in more than one world.

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="artist">The Patti Fiasco</h2><h3 class="artist">Country-Bluegrass-Americana</h3><p class="artist">Jet-fueled by powerhouse front woman Alysia Kraft, The Patti Fiasco rides the edge of emotional extreme, delivering a brash yet fiercely soulful brand of rock and roll with a heavy dose of rockabilly, blues, and ballad. At times raw and volatile, and at others, sweet and lilting, the band fuses a hard-rock swagger with the two-step of its Wyoming roots. It&#39;s the attitude of Joan Jett with a Steve Earle twang, the soul and slide of Bonnie Raitt, Black-Keys-style dirty blues-rock, and the lilting edginess of Shovels and Rope. Kraft&#39;s unrelenting energy, inspired songwriting, and vocals as pure and clean as they are powerful (Westword) earned her FoCoMA&#39;s 2013 Best Front Person award. The dobro, handmade and electrified--literally--by band member and 2007 RockyGrass dobro competition winner Ansel Foxley, builds the band&#39;s signature blend of rock, country, and Americana. Lead guitarist Dee Tyler&#39;s riffs range from gritty and driving to pensive and melodic, and his backing vocals add warmth to Kraft&#39;s pointed lyrics. On bass, Niles Mischke anchors the sound with solid, feel-good grooves, delivering an irresistible dance-floor appeal. Formidable drummer/percussionist Peter Knudson&#39;s smart yet gut-driven rhythms drive the group with a primal energy tempered by subtle sophistication. Conceived at a Wyoming open mic in 2008, The Patti Fiasco quickly earned wide critical acclaim, a devout fan base spanning the West and Midwest, and radio play across the nation. The band has shared the stage with renowned acts Big Head Todd and the Monsters, The Black Lillies, Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite, Justin Townes Earle, Great American Taxi, Cracker, Greensky Bluegrass, The Futurebirds, Born in the Flood, Lukas Nelson and the Promise of the Real, and Grammy-nominated Cajun band Feufollet. Their 2013 release, Small Town Lights, has garnered multiple accolades, including Wyoming Public Radio&#39;s Best Regional Album award, FoCoMA&#39;s Best Album award, and high positioning on the Colorado charts. It finished in the top 10 most-played Colorado records of 2013. The single of the same name received national radio play and was featured in the film Whensday. Nobody&#39;s Girl, from the band&#39;s self-titled 2011 debut, was that year&#39;s top-spun song in Colorado. The Patti Fiasco has participated in a variety of renowned showcases, including Lafayette Louisiana Downtown Alive and two appearances at SXSW, where they were backed by Colorado music powerhouse SpokesBUZZ. The WYOmericana Caravan tour, which the New York Times covered in a full-page spread, featured The Patti Fiasco in 19 shows across five states.<div class="artist_img_div"><img src="img/artist/1030qluncva1cs4_Patti_Fiasco_03.jpg" alt="web logo" class="artist_img" width="200"></div><img><div class="artist"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4wglivR6xmziFXo2RidQqi?si=-RsZ1k63SAmCj3JtHGhI9w" target="_blank" ><img src="img/listen.png"class="link_img"></a></div><h3 class="artist" style="font-size:0.95em;">Learn More About the Artist</h3><div class="artist"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Patti-Fiasco/309103025484" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/facebook.png" alt="facebook logo" class="link_img"></a></div><div class="artist"><a href="http://www.pattifiasco.net" target="_blank" title=""><img src="img/web.png" alt="web logo" class="link_img"></a></div></div>
